<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Filet mignon is the smaller tip of tenderloin and one of the 
    most expensive cuts of steak, due to its prized texture and
     that it's only about 2% of the total animal.</p> 

  <p>With our filet mignon recipe, you can recreate a classic 
    steak dinner in the comfort of your own home—no bougie 
    restaurant required. While it's relatively easy to make 
    this steakhouse main at home, because of its steeper price
     tag, you want make sure you do it right to achieve that 
     desired melt-in-your mouth texture.</p>

  <p>follow our top tips and tricks (hint: we use a generous 
    amount of butter) to learn just how to recreate this prime
     steak meal right in your very own home.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 (6-oz.) filet mignon</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. roughly chopped rosemary</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
     <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
Preheat oven to 400°. In a large skillet over medium-high heat,
 heat oil. Season steak with salt and pepper on both sides.
  When oil is just about to smoke, add steak. Cook until very
   seared, about 5 minutes, then flip and add butter and
    rosemary. Baste with butter and cook another 3 to 5 
    minutes.</li> 
     <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
Transfer skillet to oven and cook until cooked to your liking,
 about 5 minutes for medium. Pro tip: Check the temperature of
  your meat before transferring to the oven to see how far you
   are from the desired temperature. If you are within 10 
   degrees, you may need even less time. If your steak isn't
    done after 5 minutes, check every couple of minutes so you
     don't risk over cooking.</li>
    <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
Remove from pan and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I can formally assure, to anyone following this Recipe,
    that your steak will be cooked to perfection.
